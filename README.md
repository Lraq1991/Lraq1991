### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ¤” About me
<hr/>

Hello, I arrived in Uruguay at the beginning of 2017 to look for new opportunities. In Venezuela I studied seven semesters of Mechanical Engineering. For some time I have been interested in programming, last year I decided to give myself a chance to learn more and now I spend every day in front of the computer, plus I can apply knowledge I acquired during the engineering career. At the moment, I am studying accounting because it is an interesting career with good job opportunities.
